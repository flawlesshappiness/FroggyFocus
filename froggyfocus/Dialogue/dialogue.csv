##MUSHROOM_REQUEST##;There is an absence in our possession. Please fulfill our request.
##MUSHROOM_BACKGROUND_001##;We have known you since we first felt your ripples in the water.
##MUSHROOM_BACKGROUND_002##;We have always been here, and we will always be here.
##MUSHROOM_BACKGROUND_003##;And when the world does perish, we shall perish with it.
##MUSHROOM_LIFE_001##;The ground stirs. The water ripples. A swarm of life.
##MUSHROOM_LIFE_002##;A new event. To you and us both. Yet ancient it must be.
##MUSHROOM_LIFE_003##;Where is all this life coming from?
##MUSHROOM_FLOWER_001##;Every seed we have felt. Every sprout we have seen.
##MUSHROOM_FLOWER_002##;That living flower, we have neither felt nor seen before.
##MUSHROOM_FLOWER_003##;Does it disturb or disrupt? Are we threatened?
##MUSHROOM_FLOWER_004##;If this is the end, we welcome it all the same.
##MAGPIE_REQUEST##;Need worm. I give pay.
##MAGPIE_BACKGROUND_001##;Rich home not here. Rich home far away.
##MAGPIE_BACKGROUND_002##;Here many bug, so staying for a bit.
##MAGPIE_BACKGROUND_003##;After all, why leave good place?
##MAGPIE_STEALING_001##;Find many things when travel. Take many things rich home.
##MAGPIE_STEALING_002##;Home not born rich. Home rich from effort.
##MAGPIE_STEALING_003##;Effort of taking rich.
##MAGPIE_FLOWER_001##;Never seen weird flower before. Have you seen?
##MAGPIE_FLOWER_002##;Rich home have shiny flower. Pretty flower.
##MAGPIE_FLOWER_003##;Not weird flower. Hungry flower. Better not touch.
##OTTER_REQUEST##;Help me catch the winged ones.
##OTTER_SPIRITS_001##;I spend most days looking at those with wings.
##OTTER_SPIRITS_002##;There are so many and they are so beautiful, like spirits.
##OTTER_SPIRITS_003##;Where do you think they come from? What would a spirit want from our world?
##OTTER_WINGS_001##;Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to have wings.
##OTTER_WINGS_002##;To glide across the sky and run my paws through the clouds.
##OTTER_WINGS_003##;My parents said I would look silly with wings, and I will never have them so I should stop dreaming.
##OTTER_FLOWER_001##;The new flowers sticking out of the water, they're not really flowers are they?
##OTTER_FLOWER_002##;I've seen them nip after anything that gets too close. Especially the flying ones.
##OTTER_FLOWER_003##;They never get them, of course. Having wings is just better.
##LEECH_UPGRADE_START_001##;Looking to become stronger?
##LEECH_UPGRADE_START_002##;Let's unlock your potential.
##LEECH_UPGRADE_START_003##;There is true focus hidden inside you.
##SNAIL_REQUEST##;C-can you h-help me with something?
##SNAIL_LUSH_001##;Do you f-f-feel it, the warmth raining down on us here?
##SNAIL_LUSH_002##;There is a h-h-hole high above us. A w-w-window where the sun looks in.
##SNAIL_LUSH_003##;Its gaze has g-g-graced me with this lush bed of moss.
##SNAIL_SCARY_001##;The w-w-world outside the cave scares me. You are very brave for travelling here.
##SNAIL_SCARY_002##;Others l-l-like you have been here before, but they p-p-paid me no mind.
##SNAIL_SCARY_003##;They went up higher into the c-c-cave. Up where I dare not go. I'm just fine r-r-right here.
##SNAIL_CRYSTALS_001##;Have you t-t-touched the crystals?
##SNAIL_CRYSTALS_002##;Their vibrations c-c-create a peculiar tone. Some might say it s-s-sounds pretty.
##SNAIL_CRYSTALS_003##;I have my d-d-doubts. If something spends so much energy j-j-just to attract other creatures, it c-c-can't have good intentions.
##CRAB_REQUEST##;Click-clack, bring me some tough bugs!
##CRAB_TOUGH_001##;Click-clack, yeah, I'm tough. Real tough.
##CRAB_TOUGH_002##;If you had been through what I have been through, you'd know.
##CRAB_TOUGH_003##;Well, not yet, obviously, but once I get off this boring island, you'll see.
##CRAB_MANAGER_001##;Click-clack, I've been looking at that guy in the sand, over there.
##CRAB_MANAGER_002##;He is here pretty often. It looks like he is just relaxing, but he said something about "overseeing the project".
##CRAB_MANAGER_003##;Must be a tough job, if it requires so much relaxing. Some day I'll get a tough job too. Click-clack.
##CRAB_CRYSTAL_001##;Click-clack, have you seen those crystal pillars?
##CRAB_CRYSTAL_002##;They've opened up, it looks like they're expecting something.
##CRAB_CRYSTAL_003##;Those crystals, they're real tough. I'd get a crystal shell if I could.
##SALAMANDER_REQUEST##;Guess who's still stuck in a crystal. It's me! And I'm hungryyyyy...
##SALAMANDER_SINGING_001##;Ooooh, do you hear them singing?
##SALAMANDER_SINGING_002##;The crystals, all around us! They sing for us both!
##SALAMANDER_SINGING_003##;Is it not wonderful? Is it not marvelous?
##SALAMANDER_BACKGROUND_001##;Ooooh, I know what you're thinking. I see you staring at me.
##SALAMANDER_BACKGROUND_002##;One moment I'm sleeping on a nice cold crystal. Another moment we are one.
##SALAMANDER_BACKGROUND_003##;How long was the moment? Why do you care, I can sleep for however long I want.
##SALAMANDER_BACKGROUND_004##;Now I don't sleep anymore. I almost miss it.
##SALAMANDER_ENTRANCE_001##;Ooooh, once the crystals were not happy. They sang a song of anger!
##SALAMANDER_ENTRANCE_002##;There was machines and construction, a noise to no end.
##SALAMANDER_ENTRANCE_003##;But ooooh, the crystals closed the hole, the door, the entrance.
##SALAMANDER_ENTRANCE_004##;Now only the song of my sweet crystals echo the cavern walls again.
##RACCOON_REQUEST##;There is so much to dig through! Found any clues?
##RACCOON_BACKGROUND_001##;Smell that? Something fishy is going on.
##RACCOON_BACKGROUND_002##;I snuck onto one of those big cargo ships, and I jumped off here while they off-loaded some machinery.
##RACCOON_BACKGROUND_003##;Now I've just got to gather clues, and clues are always found in the trash!
##RACCOON_POLLUTION_001##;All this pollution. What's it for? What are they doing?
##RACCOON_POLLUTION_002##;The factory churns unending so it must be something huge.
##RACCOON_POLLUTION_003##;However, this trash pile has got me no clues as of yet. Perhaps I should expand my search.
##RACCOON_TV_001##;I took a look around the perimeter. Some nasty work, I must say. Did you see the oil spill?
##RACCOON_TV_002##;And those flickering TVs, what is up with those?
##RACCOON_TV_003##;All this faulty electricity can't be good for the wildlife here. When I return I will put in my vote for more regulations.
##EEL_REQUEST##;Ugh! If only I could sink my teeth in a fish.
##EEL_FISH_001##;Ugh! The fish! Where are the fish?
##EEL_FISH_002##;I've been hunting for so long, and no luck. It's just bugs on bugs on bugs.
##EEL_FISH_003##;Well, I'm tired of bugs! They all taste so... buggy. Still, an eel's got to eat.
##EEL_NASTY_001##;Ugh! Some of the bugs here are nasty!
##EEL_NASTY_002##;Covered in oil, tied up in seaweed, or stuck in plastic!
##EEL_NASTY_003##;This used to be a place brimming with juicy fish, and now it's gone all thanks to that oil-soaked brick of a factory.
##EEL_ZAP_001##;Ugh! Something zapped me as I was hunting.
##EEL_ZAP_002##;Some of the electricity around here must still be working. Have you been tinkering with it?
##EEL_ZAP_003##;The zap stunned me for a second, it was quite powerful. Which is actually giving me an idea...
##TURTLE_REQUEST##;Another day of being stuck here.
##TURTLE_DEPRESSED_001##;What's the point anymore?
##TURTLE_DEPRESSED_002##;It's all swim, eat, sleep, swim, eat, sleep, and it just goes on and on and on.
##TURTLE_DEPRESSED_003##;And look at me now. I'm stuck! I give up...
##TURTLE_THANKS_001##;Thanks for bringing me some bugs, that was actually really nice of you.
##TURTLE_THANKS_002##;While I've been lying here, I've been thinking that maybe being stuck is just a good reason to ask for help.
##TURTLE_THANKS_003##;And asking for help is nothing to feel ashamed of, right?
##TURTLE_FRIENDS_001##;The oil just keeps on coming, huh? No chance I'll be freed anytime soon I guess.
##TURTLE_FRIENDS_002##;Well, you've been helping me, and I had a chat with that raccoon guy when they stopped by sniffing the flickering TVs.
##TURTLE_FRIENDS_003##;It's nice to have someone stop by and check in, you know?
##MANAGER_INTRO_001##;Sigh... Yeah, I saw the message from HR.
##MANAGER_INTRO_002##;I'm not going to chew you out over it, since I'm really just here to relax.
##MANAGER_INTRO_002##;Let's just get you on to the next task. There's a bug in our system, and I need you to find it.
##MANAGER_INTRO_003##;It's messing with our data, so please find it and turn it in ASAP!
##MANAGER_REQUEST_001##;What?
##MANAGER_REQUEST_002##;Have you done the task?
##MANAGER_REQUEST_FAIL_001##;I don't appreciate having my vacation disturbed!
##MANAGER_REQUEST_FAIL_002##;You need to focus on the task.
##MANAGER_REQUEST_COMPLETE_001##;What's this? There was a bug in the data?
##MANAGER_REQUEST_COMPLETE_002##;I've told them before, we need more code reviewers, and what do I get? Nothing!
##MANAGER_REQUEST_COMPLETE_003##;I'll let HR know you did the task.
##PARTNER_INTRO_001##;Oh, there you are, dear. I've been waiting for you.
##PARTNER_INTRO_002##;I've been thinking long about how you can show your dedication to this relationship.
##PARTNER_INTRO_003##;You need to get me something exotic. Something that sparkles. Something beautiful.
##PARTNER_INTRO_004##;Then gift it to me. That way I will know that you truly care about me.
##PARTNER_REQUEST_001##;Hello dear.
##PARTNER_REQUEST_002##;Are you ready to show that you love me?
##PARTNER_REQUEST_FAIL_001##;I told you already.
##PARTNER_REQUEST_FAIL_002##;You need to focus on this relationship, or we're done!
##PARTNER_REQUEST_COMPLETE_001##;This is... beautiful!
##PARTNER_REQUEST_COMPLETE_002##;I'm speechless. I will put this on immediatly!
##PARTNER_REQUEST_COMPLETE_003##;I had so many doubts about us, but now I know that you truly love me!
##SCIENTIST_INTRO_001##;If it isn't my hard-working pupil, Froggy!
##SCIENTIST_INTRO_002##;Listen, don't worry about your prior performance. We're going to get you back on the horse again.
##SCIENTIST_INTRO_003##;Currently I'm researching an increased surge of life. There are bugs everywhere!
##SCIENTIST_INTRO_004##;Something must be causing this anomaly. Please investigate and return with your findings.
##SCIENTIST_REQUEST_001##;Ah, you're here!
##SCIENTIST_REQUEST_002##;Have you come upon any results?
##SCIENTIST_REQUEST_FAIL_001##;Now, I don't mean to lecture you, but...
##SCIENTIST_REQUEST_FAIL_002##;It's important that you focus on your studies.
##SCIENTIST_REQUEST_COMPLETE_001##;Oh my, what a marvelous specimen!
##SCIENTIST_REQUEST_COMPLETE_002##;This will be a big step for our research, I'm certain.
##SCIENTIST_REQUEST_COMPLETE_003##;Great work, Froggy. This deserves an A+.
##WORKER_SUSPENDED_001##;Hey buddy! Isn't it kinda late for you to clock in?
##WORKER_SUSPENDED_002##;Either way, door's locked. The foreman suspended all work when they found Fregg in a crystal.
##WORKER_SUSPENDED_003##;If you forgot anything in there, you best speak to the foreman about the code.
##WORKER_ROCK_FACTS_001##;Why am I still here?
##WORKER_ROCK_FACTS_002##;Well, the foreman said he liked me so much, he gave me this special job to watch the entrance.
##WORKER_ROCK_FACTS_003##;I bet it was all my rock facts he really liked.
##WORKER_WINDOW_001##;The foreman is taking a long lunch day.
##WORKER_WINDOW_002##;He is annoyed we are working right outside his office window.
##WORKER_WINDOW_003##;What am I supposed to do about that?
##FOREMAN_PAPER_CODE_001##;CRYSTAL CAVERN DOOR CODE:
##FOREMAN_PAPER_CODE_002##;A long sequence of numbers is circled in red
##FOREMAN_PAPER_CODE_003##;You get the feeling this will be really important to memorize.
##FOREMAN_PAPER_CODE_004##;...
##FOREMAN_PAPER_CODE_005##;You memorized the code.
##FOREMAN_PAPER_CRYSTAL_001##;A printed e-mail conversation.
##FOREMAN_PAPER_CRYSTAL_002##;They're discussing how to get someone out of a crystal.
##FOREMAN_PAPER_COPIES_001##;Someone printed the same picture of a horse several times.
##FOREMAN_PAPER_COPIES_002##;The printer ran out of color halfway, and now the horse looks very evil.
##FOREMAN_PAPER_CODE_REVIEW_001##;It's a stack of code submitted for review from several months ago.
##FOREMAN_PAPER_CODE_REVIEW_002##;It looks like they haven't been reviewed yet.
##FOREMAN_CHAIR_001##;This chair was not manufactured for you.
